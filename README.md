YTA-ify
=======

Like [YTAdventure](http://www.ytadventure.com/)? Don't want to watch just one video? This is the extension for you!

If you open a YouTube video link by mistake, YTA-ify will help you automatically open it in YTAdventure.

Warning: This means that you can't watch anything on YouTube right now. This will be fixed. (Sorry.)
